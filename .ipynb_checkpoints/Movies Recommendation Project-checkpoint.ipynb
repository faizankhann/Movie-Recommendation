What other movies did the user sample in this session? Did they start watching a movie then stop and switch to a different movie? These new data points offered a lot more clues than the ratings alone.\n",

These would be recommendations we can show on each movie's page in our app. To do this, we simple transpose the dataset to be in the shape of Movies X Users, and then cluster the movies (rather than the users) based on the correlation of their ratings.\n",
    "* We used the smallest of the datasets Movie Lens puts out. It has 100,000 ratings. If you want to dig deeper in movie rating exploration, you can look at their [Full dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) containing 24 million ratings.\n",
